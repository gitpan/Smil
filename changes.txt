0.701

Named the module more appropriately for CPAN upload, which requires a new version number.

0.7 

Added the "inline" attribute to media tags.  When you add a media file now
using the addMedia method, if you specify "inline" => 1 (or any true value)
the module will attempt to download and inline the media according to spec
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.  Thanks to Robla at RealNetworks for the
speedy answer to this.

Added quicktime extension code xmlns to the smil tag element.  Now, just specify
any of the methods listed in the qt.pl to have the module automatically add the 
quicktime namespace into the smil element.  I am including a small qt.pl file 
which demonstrates the usage of this, with a few QuickTime tags included.

Also, you no longer call 'use SYMM::Smil;' or 'new SYMM::Smil;'.  
Just 'use Smil;' now.  Also changed the webpage links and email address. 
Old scripts won't break (unless you manually delete the SYMM directory whereever it
is installed in your lib directory) but they won't be able to take advantage of 
any new functionality after and including 0.7

0.63 

Fixed a debugging error.  

0.51

Installation information was updated.  Make sure to run make after you
run the perl Makefile.pl command.

0.5

Added new member functions so that users can add arbitrary code to their 
SMIL files.  Call "addCode" to add user-defined code, or "addComment"
to add a comment.  The user is responsible for formatting.

0.44 

Updated makefile so that it uses the standard ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

0.4

The makefile is now working.  This means that you can install simply
by untarring and running "perl Makefile.PL"  

0.31

Added more datatypes to the addRegion( "sm-src" ) functionality. You
can now specify a RealText or RealPix file and the region will snoop
out the size of the files and create the region with those sizes.

0.3

New cool feature: specify a src when defining a region and the 
module will determine the media dimensions and use those dimensions
as the dimensions of the region.

$s->addRegion( "sm-src" => "http://www.server.com/img.gif" ... );

This even works with hyperlinks, if LWP is installed.  You can also
specify locally referenced files within the current filesystem.

Currently, the only media type supported is GIF, but I plan to support
JPG and of course all the RealMedia file types.  I imagine that 
Flash/Shockwave won't be too hard since the file format is publically
documented.
